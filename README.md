# üéµ Song Downloader Server (Telegram + Spotify)

A server application that allows users to **download their Spotify playlists** in **FLAC or MP3 quality** with full metadata embedding.  
The interaction happens via a **Telegram bot**, while the backend server handles Spotify authentication and metadata fetching.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This project is provided **for educational purposes only**.  
The server itself does not host or distribute copyrighted music ‚Äî it only provides the **infrastructure** to interact with Telegram bots and fetch metadata from Spotify.  
The choice of which Telegram bot to use, and the act of downloading music, is entirely the **user‚Äôs responsibility**.  
By using this software, you agree that the author assumes **no liability** for misuse, copyright violations, or illegal activity.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
1. **Telegram Bot** ‚Äì interface where the user logs in and selects music.  
2. **MTProto Client** ‚Äì handles communication between Telegram and the server.  
3. **Spotify API** ‚Äì used to fetch metadata (after user login).  
4. **Downloader Module** ‚Äì downloads and tags files with metadata.  

---

## üöÄ How It Works
1. User starts the Telegram bot.  
2. Bot asks them to log in with Spotify (OAuth).  
3. User selects a playlist.  
4. The server (via MTProto client) fetches metadata from Spotify and downloads the track(s).

## üì¶ Requirements
- Node.js (or Python backend, depending on your implementation)  
- A Telegram bot token  
- A Telegram client API ID and hash  
- A Spotify API client (ID + secret)  
- A running server (VPS or local) with storage for downloads  
- A Telegram set webhook
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

### Local Installation
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gio2chi/music-downloader.git
   cd music-downloader
   ```
2. Configure the environment (.env file).
3. Configure the config.json file following the template format:
   - "telegram_clients" is an array of strings in which are stored cookie sessions of telegram clients:
     run 
     ```bash
     node config.helper.js
     ```
     to retrieve those cookies
   - each object in the "resolvers" array is a telegram bot capable of downloading a song when sending the spotify link to it:
       "priority" determines the order in which workers are tried ‚Äî lower values are attempted first, same priority = loadbalance 
4. Initialize the database (entrypoint.sh).
5. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
6. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
### Docker Deployment
1. Build the image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t music-downloader .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name music-downloader --env-file .env -p 3000:3000 music-downloader
   ```
