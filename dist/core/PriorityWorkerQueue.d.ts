 * Class that aims to make task processing as efficient as it can.
 * Each task is first attempted by an available worker in the lowest layer; if it fails, it escalates to the next layer.
 * Workers within the same layer process tasks in parallel, while escalation between layers happens sequentially.
 *
 * @param T body of the task, aka variables needed to solve the task
 * @param R the result type after processing the task
 * @param W worker aka the entity that proceesses the task
